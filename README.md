Poller Express
==============

This GIT project demonstrates a nice, MVC like structure for creating a WordPress plugin.

The plugin itself creates a settings page in the WordPress dashboard, allowing an admin to create and edit questions
for a simple poll questionnaire. We also create a shortcode that can display the poll in any post or page, allowing the
visitor to vote, and view the results.

The plugin's output is not our focus, instead the point of this project is to teach.
You'll find a solid foundation that can be repeated in whatever plugin you can dream up.
The intended audience is for developers just getting started with WordPress.

This project contains tags that outline logical steps that take use from a basic foundation to finished product.

Step 1
------
Nothing happens here. We have a basic code skeleton that could be committed to memory if you plan to build a lot of
WordPress plugins.
